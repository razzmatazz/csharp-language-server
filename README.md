# Quick Start

csharp-ls requires the .NET 9 SDK or later to be installed on your machine.
Please head to [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) to
download it.

The server can be installed as [csharp-ls dotnet tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/csharp-ls/):

```
dotnet tool install --global csharp-ls
```
Once installed, your editor's LSP client should automatically detect and start
`csharp-ls` when opening C# project files.

# Clients

`csharp-ls` implements the standard LSP protocol to interact with your editor.
However, there are some features that require a non-standard implementation.
This is where editor-specific plugins can be helpful.
