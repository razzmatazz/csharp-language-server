# JsonRpc.fs

An F# implementation of a [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) transport layer over stdio for use with the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). It is symmetric by design and can be used on **either end** of an LSP connection — as the language server receiving requests from an editor, or as the client (e.g. in tests or a driver process) sending requests to a server.

## How it works

The transport runs as a `MailboxProcessor` actor. All I/O and state transitions go through this single actor, keeping state mutation serialised without manual locking. Inbound request and notification handlers run on the thread pool and report back to the actor via events when complete.

Messages are framed using HTTP-style `Content-Length` headers, as required by LSP.

Outbound messages are serialised through an internal write queue: if a write is already in progress when a new message is enqueued, the message waits rather than racing. This means delivery order matches enqueue order.

### Transport lifecycle

The transport moves through three phases, tracked by the `TransportPhase` discriminated union:

| Phase | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Active` | Normal operation — reading, writing, dispatching handlers. |
| `ShuttingDown` | `Shutdown` received; stdin closed, handler cancellations fired, waiting for all in-flight handlers to finish. |
| `Stopped` | All handlers have drained; every `ShutdownWaiters` channel has been notified. |

In `ShuttingDown` and `Stopped`, any new `sendJsonRpcNotification` or `sendJsonRpcCall` is rejected immediately — the caller is unblocked with a failure response and a `RpcWarn` log entry is emitted. This prevents callers from blocking indefinitely or leaking reply channels into `PendingOutboundCalls` after the peer has gone away.

## Starting the transport

```fsharp
let transport =
    startJsonRpcTransport stdin stdout rpcLogCallback (fun transport ->
        let callHandlers =
            Map.ofList [
                "myMethod", (fun ctx -> async {
                    // ctx.Params contains the request params as JToken option
                    return Ok (JValue("hello") :> JToken)
                })
            ]

        let notificationHandlers =
            Map.ofList [
                "myNotification", (fun ctx -> async {
                    // fire-and-forget, no response needed
                    ()
                })
            ]

        callHandlers, notificationHandlers
    )
```

The `configure` callback receives the transport actor before any messages are processed, so it is safe to capture it (e.g. to call `sendJsonRpcNotification` or `sendJsonRpcCall` from within handlers).

The `rpcLogCallback` is invoked on every `JsonRpcLogEntry` — reads, writes, errors, warnings, and debug messages. Pass `None` to disable logging. You can combine multiple callbacks by composing them into one:

```fsharp
let combined =
    Some (fun entry ->
        fileCallback entry
        loggerCallback entry)
```

## Receiving requests

Register an async function of type `JsonRpcCallHandler` per method name. The function receives a `JsonRpcRequestContext` and must return `Async<Result<JToken, JToken>>` — `Ok` for a successful response, `Error` for a JSON-RPC error object.

```fsharp
let handler : JsonRpcCallHandler = fun ctx -> async {
    let paramValue =
        ctx.Params
        |> Option.map (fun p -> p.ToObject<MyParams>())

    match paramValue with
    | Some p -> return Ok (serialize (doSomething p))
    | None   -> return Error (makeError -32602 "Invalid params")
}
```

Handlers support **cancellation** — if the client sends a `$/cancelRequest` notification, the handler's `CancellationTokenSource` is cancelled. The transport automatically sends a `-32800` error response if cancellation is observed.

## Receiving notifications

Register an async function of type `JsonRpcNotificationHandler` per method name. No response is sent.

```fsharp
let handler : JsonRpcNotificationHandler = fun ctx -> async {
    doSomethingWith ctx.Params
}
```

## Sending notifications

```fsharp
do! sendJsonRpcNotification transport "window/showMessage" (serialize payload)
```

Returns `Async<unit>` that completes once the message is queued for writing.

## Sending requests (outbound calls)

```fsharp
let! result = sendJsonRpcCall transport "client/registerCapability" (serialize payload)

match result with
| Ok value  -> // use value : JToken
| Error err -> // handle err : JToken
```

Returns `Async<Result<JToken, JToken>>` that completes when the peer's response arrives.

## Shutting down the transport

```fsharp
do! shutdownJsonRpcTransport transport
```

Sends a `Shutdown` event to the transport. The call **does not return until all in-flight inbound handlers have finished** — it drains before replying.

On receiving `Shutdown` the transport:

1. Stops reading from stdin (`StdIn` cleared, no new `InboundMessage` events queued).
2. Fails all pending outbound calls immediately with error `-32099` (see below).
3. Calls `.Cancel()` on the `CancellationTokenSource` of every entry in `RunningInboundRequests`.
4. Moves to `ShuttingDown` phase and parks the reply channel alongside any existing `AwaitShutdown` waiters.
5. As each handler posts `HandlerCancelled`, `HandlerCompleted`, or `HandlerFailed` back to the actor, it is removed from `RunningInboundRequests`.
6. Once the map is empty, all parked channels are notified and the phase moves to `Stopped`.

If there are no running handlers at the moment `Shutdown` arrives, steps 5–6 happen immediately inside step 4.

**Pending outbound calls are failed immediately on shutdown.** Any `sendJsonRpcCall` that is still awaiting a response at the moment of shutdown (or EOF on stdin) will be unblocked with an `Error` result carrying code `-32099` and the message `"Transport shut down"`. This prevents callers from hanging indefinitely when the peer disappears or the transport is torn down before a response arrives.

**Late `sendJsonRpc*` calls are rejected.** Once the phase is `ShuttingDown` or `Stopped`, any new `sendJsonRpcNotification` or `sendJsonRpcCall` is dropped: the notification caller is unblocked immediately, and the call caller receives the same `-32099` error. A `RpcWarn` log entry is emitted in both cases. This prevents reply channels from leaking into `PendingOutboundCalls` after the peer has gone away.

## Waiting for shutdown

```fsharp
do! awaitJsonRpcTransportShutdown transport
```

Blocks until the transport detects EOF on stdin or receives a `Shutdown` event. Use this as the main wait at the end of your server's entry point.

## Testing

Because the transport accepts arbitrary `Stream` values, it can be exercised in unit tests without spawning a process. Pass a pair of in-memory streams (e.g. `System.IO.Pipelines` or linked `MemoryStream`s) in place of stdin/stdout:

```fsharp
let clientToServer = new System.IO.MemoryStream()
let serverToClient = new System.IO.MemoryStream()

let transport =
    startJsonRpcTransport clientToServer serverToClient None (fun _ ->
        Map.ofList [ "ping", pingHandler ],
        Map.empty
    )
```

Write well-formed `Content-Length`-framed JSON into the input stream and read responses from the output stream to verify handler behaviour end-to-end.
